## What is WeissCraft? ##
WeissCraft is a collection of Minecraft Bukkit mods developed by Aaron Weiss to serve various purposes.

## Why WeissCraft? ##
I got annoyed at some simple mods not existing that I needed. It's as simple as that. I just made them.

## What's in WeissCraft? ##
Currently, there's a single mod that makes it so that blocks can only be modified by operators, but I may add more in the future.

## Is it configurable? ##
No.
